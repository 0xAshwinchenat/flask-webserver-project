# 🖥️ Secure Web Server Deployment using Flask, Docker, GitHub Actions, and Ansible

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases a full-stack deployment pipeline for a secure Flask-based web server. It demonstrates the use of DevOps practices including containerization, continuous integration/deployment, infrastructure hardening using CIS Benchmarks, and optional Terraform-based infrastructure provisioning.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python Flask
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
- **Deployment:** AWS EC2
- **Hardening & Automation:** Ansible (CIS-compliant)
- **Optional Infra as Code:** Terraform
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Manual setup (future scope)

## 🛠️ Features & Implementations

### ✅ Web Server
- Built a basic Flask application with routing logic in `routes.py`.
- Displays a homepage and a custom message.
- Dockerized the app for environment consistency.

### ✅ Dockerization
- Dockerfile with multi-stage build.
- Installs requirements from `requirements.txt`.
- Configured for efficient caching and no local state retention.

### ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- Triggered on push to `main`.
- Runs:
  - Linting and syntax checks.
  - Docker image build and push.
  - Rsync deployment to EC2 via SSH (public key authentication).

### ✅ Deployment
- Deployed to AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 22.04).
- Hardened instance using Ansible.
- SSH keys used securely with GitHub Secrets.
